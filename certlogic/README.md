## About

CertLogic is a standard for expressing logic, such as the kind you find in business/validation rules, in plain JSON format.
CertLogic is a [specified](./specification.md) subset of [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/), extended with necessary custom operations - e.g. for working with dates.
It serves as the basis for defining _interchangeable_ validation rules on top of the [Digital COVID Certificate](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en).


## Organisation

This (part of the) repository contains:

* Reference implementations of CertLogic for various platforms/programming languages - currently:
  * [JavaScript](./certlogic-js) (as NPMS package)
  * [Kotlin](./certlogic-kotlin) (as Maven/Kotlin module)
* A [validation tool](./certlogic-validation): this NPM package exposes an executable `certlogic-validate` which validates a JSON file containing a single CertLogic expression
* [JSON Schemas](./schemas) for [CertLogic expressions](./schemas/CertLogic-expression.json) and [test suites](./schemas/CertLogic-testSuite.json) JSON
* A comprehensive [test suite](testSuite): the files in this directory contain test suites conforming to [this JSON Schema](./schemas/CertLogic-testSuite.json), and are executed by the [`test-suites` Mocha test](./certlogic-js/src/test/test-suites.ts), and the [`CertLogicTests` JUnit/Kotlin ](certlogic-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/eu/ehn/dcc/certlogic/CertLogicTests.kt)
* A [build script](./build.sh) to build `certlogic-js`, `certlogic-kotlin`, and `certlogic-validation`.
* The [specification](./specification.md)


## Testing & Status

- If you found any problems, please create an [Issue](/../../issues).
- Current status: Work-In-Progress.
